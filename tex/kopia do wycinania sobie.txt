\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Research scope}
In 2014 creation of  camera based  module for chicken egg processing machines was requested by OVO-TECH company (the client).
The module is supposed to increase quality of egg-mass based  products made with use of  client machines.



The scope of this thesis is overviewing the possibilities of resolving client needs with image processing mechanisms that will optically detect state of object (batch of  intermediate product) and judge whether or not it should be discarded from the processing plant.
Moreover, a process of creating a prototype device using tested method  is described.

Problems such as:
- choosing image preprocessing methods
- finding optimal  parameters for used image alternations
- overfitting issues
- real-device solution implementation, 
- technical issues concerning the device choice, setup and performance 
had been taken  into account during the research procedure.

\subsection{Demand for improvements}


One should consider why better separation is a requirement for those companies.
Following reasons were presented:

- 


A non-disclosure agreement was signed between this client and ovo-tech, thus further expanding this topic in scope of this thesis is not possible.
